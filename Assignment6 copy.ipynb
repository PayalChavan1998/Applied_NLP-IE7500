COMES WITH ALY DELIGHTS NOW IF YOU COME ROUND THE SIDE THERE'S SOME MORE LAMBAGRINY DESIGN INSPIRATIONS ROUND HERE ON THESE FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN INCH WILLS WILLS OF THAT SIZE A GOOD THAT MEANS THE TIES ARE CHEAPER TO REPLACE ON THE SIDE IT LOOKS LIKE THIS SEA GOLL HAS BEEN AN FIGHT WITH A FRUIT NINGER CHAP CHOP CHUK CHACP BUT IT LOOKS GOOD FOR IT AND IT BREAKS UP THE WHOLE MASS OF THE SIDE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE NISSAN SECU RER BUT LIKE THE SECURER THEY SAY THEY MASTER CLASS IN PACKAGING PUSHING THE WHEELS OUT TO THE EDGE FOLSIZE DOORS NOW WHERE THE SECURER HAD A COMPROMISE WITH THE BRUTE BOOT AND A LOT OF THESE SMALL EVIES DO THIS ONE DOESN'T THOSE FAMILIAR WITH THEIR BEE WI DE DOLPHIN WILL RECOGNIZE THIS REAR ENDITS QUITE FAMILIAR BA LITTLE BIT MORE SHARPLY ANGLE IT'S GOT THE LOVELY ELY DY LIGHT HAT'S GOT THE LOVELY SPOILER AS WELL IT HAS THE LESS LOVELY BUILD YOUR DREAMS JUST TAKE THAT OFF YOU'S A HAIR DRYING TUS TAKE THE FF DON'T NEED THAT BUT WHAT WEL MORE INTERESTED IN IS THE BOOTSPACE ON THE INSIDE SO WITH THE BUTTON DOWN HERE YOT SHULD GET PRETTY DECENT THREE HUNDRED LEDERS OF BOOTSPACE YOU COUL IT TWO PROPER SIZED SUIT CASES IN THERE AND NOW IF YOURE GOING ON A LONG TRIP I KNOW AN YOU HAVE ONE PASSENGER YOU CAN FOLD DOWN THOSE REAR SEATS AND GET OVER NINE HUNDRED LEADERS AT BOOTS BASE SO NOT ONLY IS IT A GOOD LOOKING PRACTICAL SMALL SUPERMINY BBUT IT HAS ACRES OF LUGGAGE ROOM AS WELL THAT'S A WININ MY OBLEW E REALLY LUCKY TO HAVE THE TOP OF THE LINE FLIGHT VIRSION WITH ALL OF THE BELLS AND WHISTLES FIRST OF ALL IS THAT BIGGER BATTERY THIS COMES WITH FOUR HUNDRED AND FIVE KILOMETERS OF CIELT C RANCH NATS FROM THE THIRTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT EIGHT TO KILL WHAT OUR BATTERY NOT A SOMODOS HAV DE THIRTYISH KILLOR ALBATERY GIVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED CLOMATES OF SIALTIC RANGE THOUGH WE HAVE SAY THAT B WYDE'S WEAKEST POINT IS PROBABLY ITS INTERIOR DESIGN THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING A BIT WEIRD OR A LITTLE BIT WHACKY IN THESE INTERIORS I'M GLAD THEY HAVEN'T GONE FOR THE ALL BAGE BUT IS ALWAYS SOMETHING A BIT STRANGE NOW YOU MIGHT BE THINKING AH IN ORDER TO GET TO THIS PRICE THEY'VE HAD TO MAKE LOSER COMPROMISES AND YES THERE ARE SOME ECONOMIZE ATION IN HERE ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF MATERIALS ITO ONE THEE FAKE LEATHER STEERING WILL ITEM TWO LOTS OF PLASTIC ON THE DASH TO BE HONEST NOT A BIG DILL FOR ME IF YOU'RE BUYNA CART THIS PRICE DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BUT I DO HAVE SOME TEKEN HERE IT'S NOT COMPLETELY NAKED DEVOID OF ANY TECHNOGIS I HAVE SEVEN INCH SCREEN HERE WHICH IS NICE AND CLEAR THEN I GOT MY TENINCH ROTATING SCREEN OVER HERE BUT WHAT I LIKE ABOUT BEEWAIDEE IS THEY DON'T GIVE A AT THE MOMENT ABOUT SELF DRIVING TECH HAVING THE LATEST LIDARS AND RADASAD ALL THAT STUFF IN HERE WHICH MEANS THEY CAN KEEP THAT PRICE DOWN TO BE HONEST EIGHTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALLY NEED OR Y OSE THAT STUFF AT THE MOMENT NOW THERE IS AN ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM BE YOU I D WHY IS THERE A PINK POLKER DO INTERIOR IN HERE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING BUT I'M NOT SUCH A FOUND OF THAT COLOUR I'M SURE IT COMES IN MUCH MORE MUTED TONES AS WELL BUT ANYWAY THEY'VE DONE IT IN HERE AND IT LOOKS VERY PINK WHAT THEY HAVE DONE HOWEVER IS USED THIS MARINE AESTHETIC INFLUENCE SO THAT DASHBOARD IS LIKE THE WINGS OF A SEA GULL NOW TO THE AUSTRALIAN VIEWS OF FULLY CHAR THEY LOVE THIS MARINE ANIMAL AESTHETIC SO THIS WILL BE RIGHT UP YOUR STREET WHEN THIS HIT THE RHOD OF AUSTRALIA FOR ME NOT SUCH A FOUND SO THIS DIMINUTIVE PEA SIZE CAR COMES IT UNDER FOUR METRS THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLIMETRS LONG THAT'S TINY UNFORTUNATELY IN SHANGHAI WE CAN'T BUY IT EVERY CAR OF THIS PRICE HAS TO BE OVER FOUR METERS LONG IN ORDER TO GET THE FREE NUMBER AY A RIDICULOUS THING BUT THAT'S THE SHANGHAI RULES OUTSIDE OF SHANGHAI YOU CAN BUY IT NO PROBLEM BUT FOR YOU LUCKY SAUSAGES OVER SEES YOU CAN DEFINITELY B Y THIS PINT SIZED CAR NOW IT'S ALSO ONLY ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTET MILLIAMETERS WHITES IT REALLY JUST FIT IN THAT SUPER SUPERMINNI KIND OF CATEGRY SPACE FOR FOR OUR DOLT OCCUPANTS MEAN AND HE WE ARE ON THE BACK OF THE SEA GOAL BACK OF THE SEAGOLL ON TOP OF THE SEAGOAL ANYWAY LET'S GO AWAY WITH THOSE SEA GOLD THEMES AS YOU CAN SEE IN HERE IS A PRETTY SPARS AN THERE ISN'T MUCH IN THE WAY OF TEC OR FEATURES NO USE BEES I'VE GOT MY ELECTRONIC WINDOW THAT IS IT BUT I DO HAVE A LOT OF COMFORT AND A LOT OF SPACE AS YOU CAN SEE MY LEGS MY LEG ROOM IS NOT COMPROMISED AT ALL THEY'RE NOT STICKING UP TO HIGH THE BATTERY IN THE FLOOR  NATURAL FACT THIS IS PRETTY GOOD FOR A SMALL COMPACT ARK I CAN SEE OUT THE BAG I SEE OUT THE SIDES IT'S NOT BAD AND TO BE HONEST IT'S HARD TO NIT PICKA CAR WHICH IS THIS PRICE WHEN YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE FEATURES INSIDE HERE THE ONLY THING I WOULD LIKE IS MAYBE A US B SOP FOR A CHARGING A PHONE CHARGER ON SPECIAL ON THE TOP TOP OF THE RANGE MODEL MAYBE THEY CAN DO THAT IN THE FUTURE BUT TE IS ONE WIRELESS CHARGER FOR ONE PERSON'S PHONE IN THE FRONT ON THIS MODEL ONLY DO IT DOES HAVE SOME FEATURES BUT THERE MOSTLY IN THE FROMT THE FACT FOR ZIPPING IN AND OUT TRAFFIC THIS CAR IS PERFECT ONE THING I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS CAR IS THE DAINTY LITTLE DRIVE MOD NOB NOW USUALLY THERE'S SOME GARGANTUOU THING DOWN HERE THAT YOU HAVE TO SHIFT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BUT ON HEARE IT'SA VERE VERY DELICATE A CIRCULAR BUTTON T YOU JUST TIP UP WITH YOUR FINGER TO PUT IT THE REVERSE AND DOWN FOR DRIVE THAT'S A REALLY NICE FEATURE NOW THE CAR COMES WITH FOUR MODES ECO SPOR COMFR AND SNOW MODE WHICH ARE QUITE INTERESTING ON A SMALL CAR LIKE THIS AT THE MOMENT I THINK WE ARE IN EQUO MODE WHICH IS REALLY THE ONLY MODE THAT YOU NEED AND AGAIN LIKE MOST BEWAY DE KARS THEY HAVEN'T JUST STUFFED EVERYTHING IN THE SCREEN WHICH I THINK IS A BIT LAZY THEY THOUGHT ABOUT O KE WHAT BUTTONS DO PEOPLE WANT TO PRESS THE DRIVE MODES THERE DOWN HERE AS BUTTONS THE AIR CONDITIONING DON'T HAVE TO DIVE INTO MEN YOU PRESS IT ON ANOFV HERE FOR I LIKE THAT PART BE WAY DEA AND I LIKE HOW BE HONEST THEY FOCUSSED ON THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT IN TA CAR THEY DON'T WANT EVERYSINGLE TECT BI TEM IN THE WORLD AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT EVERYTHING STUFFED ON THE SCREEN SO WILL DUN BE W I DE BOT THAT LITTLE FEATURE SO THEN THE SEA GOAL ABSOLUTELY TICKS ALL THE BOXES AND MAKES THIS A TRULY STAND OUT CAR IF IT WEREN'T FOR JUST ONE SMALL FISH THAT ISSUE THING THAT DYNAMICALLY THE CAR IS SHALL WE SAY OR LESS AN EXCITED REAL WH OF COURSE IT'S FINE FOR YOUR CITY DRIVING YOUR MOTORWAY DRIVING BUT IT DOESN'T FILL ME WITH FIZ OR EXCITEMENT BUT ACTUALLY THAT'S OKT AND I DON'T MIND AND I THINK A COMPACT CAR A SUPER SUPERMINNY LIKE THIS THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE AND IN FACT IT DESPATCHES WITH THE ZERO TO FIFTY CLOMETER AND OUR TIME IN FOUR POINT NINE SECONDS IMPRESSIVE WHEN YOU CONSIDER THIS HAS A TINY FI FIFTY FIVE KILLAWOT MOTOR IT WASO HAS A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MNEWTON METERS OF TALK SO IT HAS ENOUGH  TO GET PAST CARS IN N THE CITY AN ACCELERATE WAY QUICKLY ENOUGH WILL DON'T SOMETHING TO BLOW YOUR WIG OFF NOW IF THING  BE BRUTALLY HONEST I THINK THE BREAKS LEAVE A LOT TO BE DESIRED THE'RE A BIT SPONGY AN BUT IF YOU'RE DRIVING SLOWLY ROUN THE CITY THEY SHOULD BE O K WE'RE DOING SOME EEN FASTER THAN USUAL MANEUVRES AND I DOESN'T FILL ME WITH CONFIDENCE WHEN I'M STAMPING ON THE BRAK THEIR O K BUT AS YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A REASONABLY PRICE CAR THER NOT THE BEST BUT TO BE ON US THESE ARE VERY MINOR LITTLE COMPLAINTS ON WHAT OVER ALL IS A REALLY REALLY COMPELLING CALF FOR THE PRICE THAT YOU PAY I HAV REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER COMPLAINTS YOUAR A GOOD PIECE OF NEWS IS THAT THE CAR IS PRETTY CHOIET IN FACT WHEN YOUARE DAZZING ALONG THE MOTOR WAY YOU'RE GOING UT HIGHER THAN CITY SPES IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD ON SMALLER ROADS LIKE THIS WERE EL ONLY DOING ABOUT A FORTY SEVEN CLOMITERS AN HOUR IT'S ACTUALLY VE REQUIRE AS WELL THE ACCELARATION IS SMOOTH IT'S REALLY SIMPLE TO YOU SIMPLE TO DRIVE ANDI DON'T HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS AROUND THAT EITHER MY ONLY REAL REGRET THOU IS HIS CARDUS DOESN'T HAVE THAT EXTRA FIZZ I THINK A HALO CAR WITH A BIT MORE SPORTY SUSPENSION MADEEE SPORTY BREAKS WOULD MAKE IT VILL REALLY GOOD HOWEVER UNFORTUNATELY THAT ISN'T IN THE WORKS AT THE MOMENT IS BUILT TO A PRICE AND IT'S BUILT TO APPEAL TO THE MASS MARKET I THINK THERE'S GOI TO BE A LOT OF EXECUTIVE SWEATING WHEN THIS CAR COMES OUT ON TO GLOBAL MARKETS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BUT TO SEE WHAT I THINK ABOUT OTHER BEWI DE CARS WHICH WILL MAKE OTHER JECTIVES SWEAT A LOT LOOK AT MY B WAY D ATO THREE VIDIO HERE AN MIGHT B WAY D SITILL VIDI OVER HERE\n"

SURE IT COMES IN MUCH MORE MUTED TONES AS WELL BUT ANYWAY THEY'VE DONE IT IN HERE AND IT LOOKS VERY PINK WHAT THEY HAVE DONE HOWEVER IS USED THIS MARINE AESTHETIC INFLUENCE SO THAT DASHBOARD IS THE WINGS OF A SEA GULL NOW TO THE AUSTRALIAN VIEWS OF FULLY CHAR THEY LOVE THIS MARINE ANIMAL AESTHETIC SO THIS WILL BE RIGHT UP YOUR STREET WHEN THIS HIT THE RHOD OF AUSTRALIA FOR ME NOT SUCH A FOUND SO THIS DIMINUTIVE PEA SIZE CAR COMES IT UNDER FOUR METRS THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLIMETRS LONG THAT'S TINY UNFORTUNATELY IN SHANGHAI WE CAN'T BUY IT EVERY CAR OF THIS PRICE HAS TO BE OVER FOUR METERS LONG IN ORDER TO GET THE FREE NUMBER AY A RIDICULOUS THING BUT THAT'S THE SHANGHAI RULES OUTSIDE OF SHANGHAI YOU CAN BUY IT NO PROBLEM BUT FOR YOU LUCKY SAUSAGES OVER SEES YOU CAN DEFINITELY B Y THIS PINT SIZED CAR NOW IT'S ALSO ONLY ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTET MILLIAMETERS WHITES IT REALLY JUST FIT IN THAT SUPER SUPERMINNI CATEGRY SPACE FOR FOR OUR DOLT OCCUPANTS MEAN AND HE WE ARE ON THE BACK OF THE SEA GOAL BACK OF THE SEAGOLL ON TOP OF THE SEAGOAL ANYWAY LET'S GO AWAY WITH THOSE SEA GOLD THEMES AS YOU CAN SEE IN HERE IS A PRETTY SPARS AN THERE ISN'T MUCH IN THE WAY OF TEC OR FEATURES NO USE BEES I'VE GOT MY ELECTRONIC WINDOW THAT IS IT BUT I DO HAVE A LOT OF COMFORT AND A LOT OF SPACE AS YOU CAN SEE MY LEGS MY LEG ROOM IS NOT COMPROMISED AT ALL THEY'RE NOT STICKING UP TO HIGH THE BATTERY IN THE FLOOR NATURAL FACT THIS IS PRETTY GOOD FOR A SMALL COMPACT ARK I CAN SEE OUT THE BAG I SEE OUT THE SIDES IT'S NOT BAD AND TO BE HONEST IT'S HARD TO NIT PICKA CAR WHICH IS THIS PRICE WHEN YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE FEATURES INSIDE HERE THE ONLY THING I WOULD IS MAYBE A US B SOP FOR A CHARGING A PHONE CHARGER ON SPECIAL ON THE TOP TOP OF THE RANGE MODEL MAYBE THEY CAN DO THAT IN THE FUTURE BUT TE IS ONE WIRELESS CHARGER FOR ONE PERSON'S PHONE IN THE FRONT ON THIS MODEL ONLY DO IT DOES HAVE SOME FEATURES BUT THERE MOSTLY IN THE FROMT THE FACT FOR ZIPPING IN AND OUT TRAFFIC THIS CAR IS PERFECT ONE THING I REALLY ABOUT THIS CAR IS THE DAINTY LITTLE DRIVE MOD NOB NOW USUALLY THERE'S SOME GARGANTUOU THING DOWN HERE THAT YOU HAVE TO SHIFT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BUT ON HEARE IT'SA VERE VERY DELICATE A CIRCULAR BUTTON T YOU JUST TIP UP WITH YOUR FINGER TO PUT IT THE REVERSE AND DOWN FOR DRIVE THAT'S A REALLY NICE FEATURE NOW THE CAR COMES WITH FOUR MODES ECO SPOR COMFR AND SNOW MODE WHICH ARE QUITE INTERESTING ON A SMALL CAR THIS AT THE MOMENT I THINK WE ARE IN EQUO MODE WHICH IS REALLY THE ONLY MODE THAT YOU NEED AND AGAIN MOST BEWAY DE KARS THEY HAVEN'T JUST STUFFED EVERYTHING IN THE SCREEN WHICH I THINK IS A BIT LAZY THEY THOUGHT ABOUT O KE WHAT BUTTONS DO PEOPLE WANT TO PRESS THE DRIVE MODES THERE DOWN HERE AS BUTTONS THE AIR CONDITIONING DON'T HAVE TO DIVE INTO MEN YOU PRESS IT ON ANOFV HERE FOR I THAT PART BE WAY DEA AND I HOW BE HONEST THEY FOCUSSED ON THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT IN TA CAR THEY DON'T WANT EVERYSINGLE TECT BI TEM IN THE WORLD AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT EVERYTHING STUFFED ON THE SCREEN SO WILL DUN BE W I DE BOT THAT LITTLE FEATURE SO THEN THE SEA GOAL ABSOLUTELY TICKS ALL THE BOXES AND MAKES THIS A TRULY STAND OUT CAR IF IT WEREN'T FOR JUST ONE SMALL FISH THAT ISSUE THING THAT DYNAMICALLY THE CAR IS SHALL WE SAY OR LESS AN EXCITED REAL WH OF COURSE IT'S FINE FOR YOUR CITY DRIVING YOUR MOTORWAY DRIVING BUT IT DOESN'T FILL ME WITH FIZ OR EXCITEMENT BUT ACTUALLY THAT'S OKT AND I DON'T MIND AND I THINK A COMPACT CAR A SUPER SUPERMINNY THIS THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE AND IN FACT IT DESPATCHES WITH THE ZERO TO FIFTY CLOMETER AND OUR TIME IN FOUR POINT NINE SECONDS IMPRESSIVE WHEN YOU CONSIDER THIS HAS A TINY FI FIFTY FIVE KILLAWOT MOTOR IT WASO HAS A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MNEWTON METERS OF TALK SO IT HAS ENOUGH TO GET PAST CARS IN N THE CITY AN ACCELERATE WAY QUICKLY ENOUGH WILL DON'T SOMETHING TO BLOW YOUR WIG OFF NOW IF THING BE BRUTALLY HONEST I THINK THE BREAKS LEAVE A LOT TO BE DESIRED THE'RE A BIT SPONGY AN BUT IF YOU'RE DRIVING SLOWLY ROUN THE CITY THEY SHOULD BE O K WE'RE DOING SOME EEN FASTER THAN USUAL MANEUVRES AND I DOESN'T FILL ME WITH CONFIDENCE WHEN I'M STAMPING ON THE BRAK THEIR O K BUT AS YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A REASONABLY PRICE CAR THER NOT THE BEST BUT TO BE ON US THESE ARE VERY MINOR LITTLE COMPLAINTS ON WHAT OVER ALL IS A REALLY REALLY COMPELLING CALF FOR THE PRICE THAT YOU PAY I HAV REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER COMPLAINTS YOUAR A GOOD PIECE OF NEWS IS THAT THE CAR IS PRETTY CHOIET IN FACT WHEN YOUARE DAZZING ALONG THE MOTOR WAY YOU'RE GOING UT HIGHER THAN CITY SPES IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD ON SMALLER ROADS THIS WERE EL ONLY DOING ABOUT A FORTY SEVEN CLOMITERS AN HOUR IT'S ACTUALLY VE REQUIRE AS WELL THE ACCELARATION IS SMOOTH IT'S REALLY SIMPLE TO YOU SIMPLE TO DRIVE ANDI DON'T HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS AROUND THAT EITHER MY ONLY REAL REGRET THOU IS HIS CARDUS DOESN'T HAVE THAT EXTRA FIZZ I THINK A HALO CAR WITH A BIT MORE SPORTY SUSPENSION MADEEE SPORTY BREAKS WOULD MAKE IT VILL REALLY GOOD HOWEVER UNFORTUNATELY THAT ISN'T IN THE WORKS AT THE MOMENT IS BUILT TO A PRICE AND IT'S BUILT TO APPEAL TO THE MASS MARKET I THINK THERE'S GOI TO BE A LOT OF EXECUTIVE SWEATING WHEN THIS CAR COMES OUT ON TO GLOBAL MARKETS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BUT TO SEE WHAT I THINK ABOUT OTHER BEWI DE CARS WHICH WILL MAKE OTHER JECTIVES SWEAT A LOT LOOK AT MY B WAY D ATO THREE VIDIO HERE AN MIGHT B WAY D SITILL VIDI OVER HERE\"]\n",
